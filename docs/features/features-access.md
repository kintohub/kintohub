When developing your app, you may have one or many services speaking to each other through a public API or internal API endpoint.

## View Access Information

Not all services can be accessed. [Jobs](/service-types/types-job.md) and [Background Workers](/service-types/types-backend-worker.md) do not have any accessible endpoints.

The following service types will have an **Access Tab** available

- Web App
- Backend API
- Postgres - From Catalog

The service access tab is located in the **Service View**.

1. Login to your KintoHub account
2. Create a new service or click on a Service in your [Environment](features-environment.md)
3. Click on the `Access` tab

## How It Works?

In the Access Tab, you will have all the available options to access your service.

- **Internal hostnames** are generated from the `{service-name}`.
- **External hostnames** are generated by `{service-name}`-`{5-character-environment-hash}`.kinto.io
  - Example: `backendapi-5j39f.kinto.io`

If you wish to customize your external hostname, you may set up a [Custom Domain](features-domains.md)

### Postgres

Postgres has additional access information that is generated for usage.

- **Connection String Admin** - a Postgres friendly connection URI for the root user.
- **Connection String User** - a Postgres friendly connection URI for user-specified when creating the service.
- **Root Password** - the password for the root user **postgres**.
- **Username** - the username specified when creating the service
- **Password** - the password for **username** specified when creating the service

:::note
If you programmatically change the Postgres user or password data, the information on KintoHub will be **out of sync** and unuseable.
